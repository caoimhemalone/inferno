      <h2>What Our Clients Say</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Rachael Tooher</h3>
          <span>Easiest way to push your fitness and burn some serious calories in 45 mins ever. I‘m in my 40‘s and didn‘t think I‘d ever be able to do these kind of fitness classes. But the trainers are awesome, they guide you through each class and it‘s over in no time. Best gym in Dublin!</span>

          <h3>Laura Feeney</h3>
          <span>Having been attending classes here since December. I would highly recommend the trainers(especially Martina) and classes! The class suits everybody from beginners to advanced athletes, you‘re competing against yourself. 3 machines, 15 minutes each and you‘re done!! Trainers are friendly and helpful and give you step by step guidance throughout the class. There‘s loads of parking, class times and packages to suit everyone!</span>

          <h3>Gary O‘Connor</h3>
          <span>Inferno is a brilliant experience. From the minute you walk in and are welcomed by a friendly face on reception ,  right through to when you leave 45 mins later a sweaty mess but feeling unreal. Because you are constantly watching the screen to see how hard you’re working the class goes so quickly and is over before you know it. A really good alternative for people looking for a fun alternative to their usual workouts.</span>
